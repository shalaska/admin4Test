        "Here's how to set up a basic project in Nevis to proxy access to `google.com`.  This will involve several steps and patterns, as described below. Since you haven't specified the type of authentication you require, I will assume a basic username/password setup for demonstration.  You can modify this to suit your chosen authentication method later.\n\n**Step 1: Create a New Project in NevisAdmin 4**\n\n1.  Log in to NevisAdmin 4.\n2.  Create a new project. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., \"Google Proxy\").\n\n**Step 2: Configure the Virtual Host**\n\n1.  Add a *Virtual Host* pattern to your project.\n2.  **Name:** Give it a name (e.g., \"Google Virtual Host\").\n3.  **Frontend Addresses:**  Enter the address where your nevisProxy instance will be accessible from the client.  For example: `https://myproxy.example.com`\n4.  **Bind Addresses:** Enter the actual IP address and port of your nevisProxy instance. For example: `https://192.168.1.100:443` (Ensure your nevisProxy is configured to listen on this port).\n5.  **nevisProxy:** Select the appropriate `nevisProxy Instance` pattern from the dropdown.\n6.  **Default Entry:** (Optional) You can configure this to redirect root path requests (\"/\") to a specific page or URL if you wish.\n7.  **Add-ons:** Add necessary add-ons like `Access Restriction`, `CustomProxyLogFile`, etc., as needed.  `Access Restriction` could be used to limit access from specific IP addresses.\n8. **Security Response Headers**:  Set appropriate headers such as `Strict-Transport-Security` and others to enhance security.\n9.  **Save Changes.**\n\n**Step 3: Configure the Backend Service**\n\n1.  Add a *Backend Service Access Base* pattern.\n2.  **Name:** (e.g., \"Google Backend\")\n3.  **Backend Addresses:** Enter the URL of google.com (You can use a specific path if you are not proxying the entire site). For example:  `https://www.google.com`\n4.  **Load Balancing:** Choose your preferred load balancing strategy (if applicable).  If you only have one backend, this setting is not relevant.\n5.  **Trust Store:**  If `google.com` uses HTTPS, you *must* configure a trust store containing the appropriate CA certificate to allow validation of `google.com`'s certificate.  You can use either a pre-existing Trust Store or upload the certificate directly.\n6.  **Save Changes.**\n\n**Step 4: Link the Patterns**\n\n1.  Go back to your *Virtual Host* pattern (\"Google Virtual Host\").\n2.  Under *Additional Settings*, link the *Backend Service Access Base* pattern (\"Google Backend\") you just created.\n\n**Step 5: Deploy**\n\nDeploy the configuration from nevisAdmin 4 to your nevisProxy instance.  This will create the necessary configurations on your nevisProxy server.\n\n**Step 6: Testing**\n\nAfter deployment, test that you can access `google.com` through your configured proxy address (`https://myproxy.example.com`).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Security:** This is a simplified example. For production, you should implement robust security measures, including proper authentication, authorization, and input validation. Consider using more sophisticated authentication methods beyond basic username/password.\n*   **Certificates:** Ensure your certificates are correctly configured and trusted. Incorrect configuration can lead to connection errors.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully manage potential issues.  Use the `HTTP Error Handling` pattern if necessary for customized error pages.\n*   **Logging:** Configure logging extensively to monitor the proxy's behavior.  Use the `CustomProxyLogFile` to tailor logging level and format.\n\n\nThis detailed approach ensures a more secure and robust setup than a simpler configuration. Remember to adapt the example values to your specific environment and security requirements. If you encounter any issues, consult the detailed documentation for each pattern within NevisAdmin 4 for more specific guidance.\n",

        "This is a screenshot of the NevisAdmin 4 interface for configuring a `nevisProxy` instance. Let's break down each section and how to configure it:\n\n**1. `nevisProxy` Instance:**\n\n*   **`nevisProxy`:** This field likely requires the name of the `nevisProxy` instance you wish to configure.  It might auto-populate based on your project setup, or you might need to enter it manually.  The asterisk (`*`) indicates it's a required field.\n*   **`nevisProxy Instance`:** This is likely a dropdown menu to select the `nevisProxy` instance from a list of available instances in your project.\n\n**2. `Frontend Addresses`:**\n\n*   This input field expects a list of addresses (URLs) of where the proxy will be exposed to clients, separated by spaces or newlines. The `var` button probably suggests the use of environment variables for these addresses.  Example: `https://myproxy.example.com https://proxy2.example.com`\n\n**3. `Bind Addresses`:**\n\n*   This input field requires the actual IP address(es) and port number(s) that the `nevisProxy` instance will listen on. One value per line is required.  Example:\n    ```\n    192.168.1.100:443\n    10.0.0.10:80\n    ```\n\n**4. `Frontend Key Store`:**\n\n*   A dropdown menu to select a keystore pattern that will be used for outbound TLS connections. This is essential for HTTPS. You likely have to create a pattern (using `Automatic Key Store`, `PEM Key Store`, or similar) and select it from this menu.\n\n**5. `Frontend Trust Store`:**\n\n*   Similar to the Key Store, this dropdown selects a trust store pattern for verifying certificates of servers your proxy connects to. Create a pattern (using `Automatic Trust Store`, `PEM Trust Store`, or similar) if needed.\n\n**6. `Frontend TLS Settings`:**\n\n*   This likely contains settings specific to the TLS protocol used by the `nevisProxy`. It might offer options such as `SSLProtocol` and `SSLCipherSuite`.\n\n\n**7. `Notes`:**\n\n*   This section is likely for adding any relevant administrator notes about the configuration.\n\n**To Save Changes:** Click the \"Save changes\" button.  The \"Reset\" button will revert the form to its default values.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   The asterisks (`*`) indicate mandatory fields.\n*   The question mark icons (`?`) likely provide help or further details for each field when clicked.\n*   Proper certificate management (`Frontend Key Store` and `Frontend Trust Store`) is critical for securing your `nevisProxy` instance, especially when using HTTPS.  Incorrect configuration can cause connection issues.\n\n\nRemember to consult the NevisAdmin 4 documentation and the help information available within the interface for detailed explanations of each setting and its options.\n",

        "To add local authentication to your Nevis setup, you'll need to configure an `Authentication Realm` pattern.  This realm will define how users are authenticated against a local user database (rather than an external identity provider like LDAP or SAML).  The exact configuration will depend on whether you want to use username/password, a second factor like a one-time password (OTP), or other authentication mechanisms.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps involved, assuming a simple username/password local authentication:\n\n**1. Create a New `Authentication Realm` Pattern:**\n\n1.  In NevisAdmin 4, create a new pattern of type \"Authentication Realm.\"\n2.  Give it a name (e.g., \"Local Authentication Realm\").\n\n**2. Configure the `Authentication Realm`:**\n\n1.  **`Name`:** Choose a descriptive name for this realm.\n2.  **`Description`:** Provide a brief description of the realm's purpose.\n3.  **`Labels`:** Define labels (text that will be displayed to the user) for your login form, error messages, and other UI elements.  You'll want to provide translations for different languages.\n4.  **`nevisAuth Instance`:** Select the `nevisAuth` instance to use for authentication.\n5.  **`nevisIDM`:**  Select a nevisIDM Instance or nevisIDM connector pattern. This is needed for the local user database.\n6.  **`Database`:**  This is where you specify settings for your database connection.  You'll typically need to provide the connection string, username, password, and database type (e.g., MariaDB, PostgreSQL).  The database *must* exist beforehand.  Consider using strong password management practices.  The type of database you can use depends on your nevisIDM instance and configuration.\n7.  **`Initial Authentication Flow`:**  This is the primary authentication flow.  You will add a pattern to this field that defines the authentication method.  For a username/password login:\n    *   Add a *`nevisIDM Password Login`* pattern.\n    *   Configure the `nevisIDM Password Login` pattern:\n        *   **`loginType`:** Select `LOGINID` (to use the `loginId` attribute from nevisIDM for login).  You can also choose `EMAIL` (to use the email address) or `AUTO` (to attempt both). `LOGINID` is often more efficient.\n        *   **`attributes`:** Specify the nevisIDM attributes to fetch for the user (at minimum `loginId`, `extId`, and `email`).\n        *   **`properties`:**  (Optional) Fetch additional properties from nevisIDM for the user.\n        *   **`onSuccess`:** Configure the next step in the authentication flow after successful login (e.g., `Authentication Done` or another step).\n        *   **`onFailure`:** Configure what happens if login fails. (e.g., display an error and allow another attempt or redirect to another step).\n        *   **`onPasswordExpired`:**  Configure the step to execute when the user needs to change their password.\n8.  **`Session Timeout`:** Configure the session timeout settings for your realm.\n9.  **`maxSessionLifetime`:** Configure the maximum allowed session lifetime.\n10. **`sessionValidation`:** Define the session validation rules, if needed (e.g., to invalidate sessions if the source IP changes).\n11. **`sessionTracking`:** Set this to `COOKIE` to use session cookies for tracking.\n12. **`defaultLabels`:**  Configure the default labels and their translations.\n13. **`addons`:**  Add any additional patterns, as needed (for example, `Authorization Policy` to define required roles or authentication levels).\n14. **`Save Changes`:** Save the changes to your `Authentication Realm` pattern.\n\n**3. Link the `Authentication Realm` to Your Application:**\n\n1.  Go to the *Web Application*, *REST Service*, or *SOAP Service* pattern that you want to protect.\n2.  In the appropriate field (usually \"Authentication Realm\"), select the \"Local Authentication Realm\" pattern you just created.\n\n**4. Deploy**\n\nDeploy the updated configuration to your nevisProxy and nevisAuth instances.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Error Handling:** Always implement proper error handling in your `nevisIDM Password Login` configuration to address login failures gracefully.\n*   **Security:** Use strong password policies in nevisIDM and secure your database connection.\n*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test your local authentication to ensure it functions as expected.\n*   **Second Factor:** For enhanced security, consider adding a second factor (e.g., OTP, SMS, hardware token) to your `Authentication Realm`.  This would involve adding additional AuthStates to your authentication flow.\n\n\nThis detailed guide provides a solid foundation for implementing local authentication.  Always refer to the Nevis documentation for specific details and options based on your chosen authentication methods and components.  The exact field names and options might vary slightly depending on your NevisAdmin version.\n",

        "That screenshot shows the NevisAuth Realm configuration screen. To add local authentication, you need to specify the authentication method in the \"Initial Authentication Flow\" section.  Here's how:\n\n1. **Select the \"Initial Authentication Flow\" Field:** Click on the dropdown in this section.\n\n\n2. **Choose the Authentication Method:** You will see a list of available authentication patterns.  Select the pattern that represents your desired local authentication method. The most straightforward option for local authentication is **`nevisIDM Password Login`**. This pattern leverages your existing nevisIDM user database for authentication.  Other options might include:\n    * **`Dummy Login`**: This is a simple pattern for testing, it doesn't actually perform real authentication.  \n    * **`Generic Authentication Step`**: This offers highly customized authentication flows, but requires more in-depth configuration (building a chain of AuthStates within the XML editor).\n\n3. **Configure the Selected Pattern:** Once you've selected the pattern (like `nevisIDM Password Login`), you will be taken to its configuration screen.  There you will need to:\n    *   **Link to `nevisIDM`:** Choose the correct `nevisIDM` instance or connector pattern to link the authentication to the user database.\n    *   **Database Configuration:**  Provide database connection details (connection string, username, password).  This is extremely important and should be carefully secured.\n    *   **`loginType`:**  Configure the login type (e.g., `LOGINID`, `EMAIL`, or `AUTO`). `LOGINID` is generally preferred for efficiency.\n    *   **`attributes`:** Specify the nevisIDM user attributes to fetch (e.g., `loginId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`).\n    *   **`properties`:** (Optional) You can configure additional properties to retrieve from nevisIDM.\n    *   **`onSuccess` and `onFailure`:** Determine the next steps in your authentication flow based on whether login was successful or not. For example, you could link a `Success` step to `Authentication Done` and a `Failure` step to show an error message and allow another attempt.\n\n\n4. **Save Changes:** After configuring the selected authentication pattern, save the changes in the `Authentication Realm`.\n\n5. **Link to Application:** In the main Authentication Realm settings, you'll also need to configure the Session Upgrade Flows, Logout Flow, and Application Access Tokens.  Make sure your Application (Web App, REST, SOAP) points to this newly configured Authentication Realm.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Security:** Use robust security practices.  Never hardcode passwords directly in the configuration; always use environment variables or Nevis' secure credential mechanisms.\n*   **Error Handling:**  Implement proper error handling in your authentication flow (using the `onFailure` option) to prevent unexpected behavior.\n*   **Testing:** Test your setup thoroughly after deployment to ensure it functions correctly.\n\nRemember to consult the NevisAdmin documentation for more detailed explanations of each setting.  The exact available options and procedures might vary slightly depending on your specific version of NevisAdmin.\n",

        "You're right to point that out; the screenshot only shows the top-level selection for the Authentication Realm.  The actual choice of authentication method (username/password, OTP, etc.) isn't made directly on that screen.  Instead, it's done by selecting the appropriate *authentication pattern* within the \"Initial Authentication Flow\" section.\n\nThe \"Initial Authentication Flow\" dropdown is where you select a pattern defining the authentication process. This pattern will then determine the specific authentication method (username/password, OTP, etc.) used.  Here's the corrected process:\n\n\n1.  **Select `Initial Authentication Flow`:**  Click on the dropdown menu under \"Initial Authentication Flow\" in the screenshot.\n\n2.  **Choose an Authentication Pattern:**  A list of patterns will appear.  You need to select a pattern that defines the authentication method you want to use.  The most common options for local authentication include:\n    *   **`nevisIDM Password Login`:** This is the standard option for username/password authentication against your nevisIDM user database.  This is generally recommended for its efficiency and security.\n    *   **`Dummy Login`:** This is a placeholder pattern useful only for testing purposes.  It doesn't perform actual authentication.\n    *   **`Generic Authentication Step`:**  This is for highly customized authentication flows. You'll build the specific steps (AuthStates) using XML in a separate editor. This is the most flexible but also the most complex option.  This option allows for very complex multi-step authentication flows but requires a solid understanding of the nevisAuth framework and is best avoided unless necessary for complex use-cases.\n    *   Other patterns, depending on your setup, may also provide various authentication methods. For example you might see patterns related to SAML, OAuth, or other identity providers. Those should be avoided for local authentication.\n\n3.  **Configure the Chosen Pattern:** After selecting the pattern, you'll be taken to a separate configuration screen for that specific pattern. This is where you'll provide the detailed settings (database connection, user attributes, etc.) for the selected authentication method.  For example if you choose `nevisIDM Password Login`, you will need to specify:\n    *   `nevisIDM` instance\n    *   database connection details\n    *   user attributes to retrieve\n    *   success and failure transitions\n\n4.  **Save Changes:** Save the changes to the chosen pattern.  This completes the setup of your local authentication.  Remember to then link the Authentication Realm to your application.\n\n\nIn summary, the \"Initial Authentication Flow\" dropdown doesn't directly select the *method*, but rather the *pattern* that *implements* the authentication method. Make sure you choose the right pattern to implement the desired authentication.\n",

        "To enable access to the nevisIDM Administration GUI through your Nevis proxy, you'll need to configure a few patterns in NevisAdmin 4.  The specific steps might vary slightly depending on your NevisAdmin version, but the general process is as follows:\n\n\n**1. Prerequisites:**\n\n*   **nevisIDM Instance:** You must have a properly configured nevisIDM instance running and accessible.\n*   **Authentication Realm:** You need an `Authentication Realm` pattern set up to handle authentication for access to the nevisIDM GUI. This usually involves configuring a login method (e.g., `nevisIDM Password Login`).\n*   **Nevis SecToken:** An Application Access Token pattern (usually `Nevis SecToken`) should be defined and linked to your Authentication Realm to provide authorization and propagate user identity.  The token will be used to authenticate requests to the nevisIDM API.\n\n\n**2. Create the `nevisIDM Web Application` Pattern:**\n\n1.  In NevisAdmin 4, add a new pattern of type \"nevisIDM Web Application.\"\n2.  Give it a meaningful name (e.g., \"nevisIDM Admin Access\").\n3.  **`nevisIDM`:** Select the nevisIDM instance you wish to access.\n4.  **`Authentication Realm`:**  Select the `Authentication Realm` pattern you previously set up.\n5.  **`Application Access Tokens`:** Select the `Nevis SecToken` pattern (or whichever token mechanism you configured within the Realm).\n6.  **`apiAccess`:** Set this to `enabled`. This enables the nevisIDM REST API access.\n7.  **`selfAdmin`:** Set this to `enabled`. This exposes the nevisIDM self-administration GUI.\n8.  **Save changes.**\n\n**3. Create the Virtual Host Pattern (if you don't already have one):**\n\n   If you don't have an existing *Virtual Host* pattern, you will need to create one. This pattern defines the entry point in nevisProxy for all applications.  It should be set up as follows:\n\n1.  Add a `Virtual Host` pattern.\n2.  Give it a name (e.g., \"nevisIDM Virtual Host\").\n3.  **`Frontend Addresses`:** Enter the public URL(s) where your nevisProxy will be exposed to clients. For example: `https://myproxy.example.com`\n4.  **`Bind Addresses`:**  Enter the IP address(es) and port(s) that the `nevisProxy` instance listens on. For example: `192.168.1.100:443`.\n5.  **`nevisProxy`:** Select the appropriate `nevisProxy Instance` pattern from the dropdown menu.\n6.  **`Frontend Key Store`:** Select your key store pattern for TLS (HTTPS) connections.\n7.  **`Frontend Trust Store`:** Select a truststore pattern to enable HTTPS connections and to trust the certificates coming from your nevisIDM instance.\n8.  **`Add-ons`:**  You might want to include add-ons such as `Access Restriction` and `Security Response Headers`.\n9.  **Save changes.**\n\n**4. Link the `nevisIDM Web Application` to the `Virtual Host`:**\n\n1.  Go to your *`nevisIDM Web Application`* pattern (\"nevisIDM Admin Access\").\n2.  In the *Additional Settings* section, assign the *Virtual Host* pattern you've just created.\n\n**5. Deploy**\n\nDeploy your updated configuration. The nevisIDM admin GUI should now be accessible via a URL similar to this:  `https://<your-nevisproxy-frontend-address>/nevisidm/admin/`.  You will be prompted to log in using your configured authentication method and appropriate credentials.\n\n\n**Important Security Considerations:**\n\n*   **Access Control:**  Restrict access to the nevisIDM admin GUI appropriately. Use the `Access Restriction` add-on pattern in the *Virtual Host* pattern to define allowed IP addresses or other access restrictions.  This is *crucial* for security.\n*   **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to protect the communication with the nevisIDM admin GUI.\n*   **Strong Authentication:** Use a strong authentication method (e.g., two-factor authentication) for accessing nevisIDM.  The realm is crucial here.\n*   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit your nevisIDM security configuration.\n\nRemember to check the NevisAdmin documentation for specific configuration details and instructions.

Add a new pattern of type \"SAML SP Connector\".\n    2.  **`Name`:** (e.g., \"SP Connector -  MyApp\")\n    3.  **`IDP Issuer`:** Enter the same `Issuer` value you defined in the SAML IDP pattern.\n    4.  **`SP Issuer`:** Enter the unique identifier of the SP.\n    5.  **`ACS URL`:**  The Assertion Consumer Service URL. This is where the SP sends the SAML Response. You will get this from your Service Provider's documentation.\n    6.  **`Selection Expression`:** (If you have multiple IdPs configured, this would define which IdP to use based on conditions).  If you have only one IdP, this is irrelevant.\n    7.  **`SP Signer Trust`:**  Configure a trust store pattern to validate the SP's certificate.\n    8. **`Binding`:** select whether the SP uses the POST or Redirect binding.\n    9.  **`Signing`:** Define what to sign in the SAML assertion (usually, the entire response).\n    10. **`Save Changes`.**\n\n\n4.  **Link the Connector to the IdP:**  Go back to the SAML IdP pattern and link the SAML SP Connector patterns you just created.\n\n5.  **Deploy:** Deploy the configuration to your Nevis instance.\n\n**Method 2: OpenID Connect (OIDC) IdP Setup**\n\nThis uses the OpenID Connect protocol.  It's generally more modern and flexible than SAML.\n\n\n1.  **Create an OAuth2 Authorization Server Pattern:**\n    1.  In NevisAdmin 4, add a new pattern of type \"OAuth2 Authorization Server.\"\n    2.  Give it a name (e.g., \"Nevis OIDC IdP\").\n\n2.  **Configure the OAuth2 Authorization Server Pattern:**\n    1.  **Basic Settings:**\n        *   **`Name`:**  Descriptive name.\n        *   **`Realm`:** Select your Authentication Realm.  This defines how users are authenticated.\n        *   **`oidcIssuer`:**  The Issuer identifier (typically a URL).  **Critical:** Your RPs *must* know this value.\n        *   **`Virtual Host`:** Select a Virtual Host pattern.\n        *   **`signer`:** Select a key store pattern for signing tokens.\n        *   **`clientAuth`:** Configure the client authentication method.\n        *   **`Save Changes`.**\n    2.  **Advanced Settings:** Configure things like token lifetimes, allowed origins, etc.\n    3.  **Save Changes.**\n\n3.  **Configure OAuth 2.0 Clients (For Each Service Provider):**  For each Relying Party (RP), you'll need to define an OAuth 2.0 Client. This is usually done via the nevisMeta Web Console (or potentially through the nevisAuth REST API, depending on your setup).   You'll provide details such as:\n    *   Client ID and Client Secret\n    *   Redirect URIs\n    *   Scopes\n\n4.  **Deploy:** Deploy to your Nevis instance.\n\n\n**Important Notes for Both Methods:**\n\n*   **Certificate Management:**  For both SAML and OIDC, proper keystore and truststore configuration is crucial for security and proper functioning. Use automatic key management for simplicity during development and testing; for production, switch to a more secure method.\n*   **Metadata:**  For SAML, you'll likely need to provide your IdP's metadata to your Service Providers. For OIDC, the metadata is typically provided via a well-known URL (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`).\n*   **Testing:**  Always test your IdP setup thoroughly with your Service Providers to ensure it's working correctly.\n\n\nThis is a high-level overview. The detailed steps and configuration options might vary depending on your specific NevisAdmin 4 version and setup.  Always consult the comprehensive Nevis documentation for detailed instructions and examples for your setup.  It's important to understand the nuances of both SAML and OIDC to choose the best approach for your environment.\n",

        "Setting up Nevis as a Service Provider (SP) means configuring it to receive and process authentication assertions from an Identity Provider (IdP).  This is typically done using SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC). Here's a guide for both methods:\n\n**Method 1: SAML 2.0 SP Setup**\n\nThis method uses the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 protocol.\n\n1.  **Create a SAML SP Realm Pattern:**\n    1.  In NevisAdmin 4, create a new pattern of type \"SAML SP Realm.\"\n    2.  Give it a descriptive name (e.g., \"Nevis SAML SP Realm\").\n\n2.  **Configure the SAML SP Realm Pattern:**\n    1.  **Basic Settings:**\n        *   **`Name`:** A user-friendly name for the realm.\n        *   **`nevisAuth Instance`:** Select the `nevisAuth` instance.\n        *   **`Virtual Host`:**  Assign a *Virtual Host* pattern to define the entry point for this SAML SP Realm.\n        *   **`Authentication Realm`:** This is where the user will be authenticated after a successful SAML assertion. Select the Authentication Realm pattern defining the authentication method.\n        *   **`SAML Token`:** Choose a token pattern (e.g., `Nevis SecToken`, `JWT Token`, `SAML Token`).  This will propagate the authenticated user's identity to the backend application.\n        *   **`Logout Confirmation`:** Choose whether to present a confirmation to the user before logging them out.\n        *   **`addons`:** Add any needed additional patterns (e.g., `Authorization Policy`).\n        *   **`Save Changes`**.\n\n    2.  **Advanced Settings:** This tab usually allows further configuration and customization (e.g. timeout settings, session handling, and logout settings).  Carefully configure as needed.  The settings for session handling have important implications.\n    3.  **Save Changes.**\n\n3.  **Create a SAML SP Connector Pattern:**\n    1.  Add a pattern of type \"SAML SP Connector.\"\n    2.  **`Name`:**  Give it a name (e.g., \"SP Connector - MyApp\").\n    3.  **`Authentication Level`:** Set the minimum required authentication level.\n    4.  **`IDP Issuer`:** Enter the unique identifier for your Identity Provider (IdP). This is a crucial identifier obtained from your IdP's metadata.\n    5.  **`SP Issuer`:** (optional) Enter the `Issuer` of your SP; usually it matches the *Assertion Consumer Service URL*.\n    6.  **`Assertion Consumer Service`:** The URL path where the IdP will send the SAML Response. This path should be configured to point to your Nevis application. Note that this is relative to the `Virtual Host`.\n    7.  **`Single Logout Service`:**  (Optional) The URL where the IdP can send a logout request.\n    8.  **`Binding`:** Choose your preferred binding method for incoming SAML messages (POST or Redirect).\n    9.  **`EncryptionCert`:** Assign a Key Store pattern. The certificate is used to encrypt the outgoing messages to the service provider.\n    10. **`DecryptionKey`:** Assign a pattern for decryption.\n    11. **`SignatureValidation`:** Define the SAML elements for which signature validation is performed.  This is a very important security setting.  \"Both\" is the most secure, but may not be supported by all IdPs.\n    12. **`Save Changes`.**\n\n4.  **Link the Connector to the Realm:** Go back to the SAML SP Realm pattern.  In the `SamlSpConnector` field, link the `SamlSpConnector` pattern you just created.\n\n5.  **Deploy:** Deploy the configuration to your Nevis instance.\n\n\n**Method 2: OpenID Connect (OIDC) SP Setup**\n\nThis method uses the OpenID Connect protocol.\n\n\n1.  **Create an `Authentication Realm` Pattern:**  Create an *Authentication Realm* pattern to handle user authentication after receiving the ID token from the OIDC provider.\n\n2.  **Configure the `Authentication Realm` Pattern:**\n    1.  Configure the authentication flow for this realm (this is typically a password login against a nevisIDM instance).\n    2.  **`addons`:** Add an *AccessTokenConsumer* pattern to handle the access token from the OIDC provider.\n\n\n3.  **Configure the Access Token Consumer Pattern:**\n    1.  In the *AccessTokenConsumer* pattern:\n        *   **`authorizationServer`:**  Set the URL of your OIDC Authorization Server (this is where the access token is obtained).\n        *   **`onSuccess`:** Define the next step after successful token validation.\n        *   **`onMissingToken`:** Set a step for when the access token is missing.\n\n4.  **Configure Your Application:** In your application, ensure that the code is correctly configured to make the OpenID Connect Authorization Server calls to request and obtain the access token, and to pass this to the Access Token Consumer.\n\n5.  **Deploy:** Deploy the changes to your Nevis instance.\n\n\n**Important Notes for Both Methods:**\n\n*   **Metadata:**  You'll need to provide your SP's metadata to your Identity Provider.  This information tells the IdP how to send authentication assertions to your Nevis instance.  There are usually ways to download this from your IdP's configuration.\n*   **Certificates & Keys:** Proper key management is crucial, especially in the SAML flow.  Use secure storage (e.g., a hardware security module or nevisKeybox).\n*   **Testing:** Always test the entire flow thoroughly to make sure that it functions as intended before deploying to production.\n\nThis is a general guide. The specific steps might vary depending on your NevisAdmin version, the chosen authentication methods, and the specific capabilities of your IdP. Always refer to the Nevis documentation for the most up-to-date and detailed instructions for your specific use case.\n",

        "To utilize refresh tokens with the authorization code flow in Nevis, you need to configure your OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server appropriately.  Here's how:\n\n**1.  Ensure `offline_access` Scope is Enabled:**\n\nThe `offline_access` scope is what signals to the authorization server that a refresh token should be issued along with the access token.  You need to ensure this scope is correctly defined and allowed for your clients:\n\n1.  Access your nevisMeta instance (usually via a web console).\n2.  Find the OAuth 2.0 setup you're using.\n3.  Edit this setup and check (or add) the `offline_access` scope. Ensure that the consent for this scope is configured appropriately in your setup.  This means determining if user consent is required and how it will be obtained (via a consent screen in your application, etc.).\n4.  Save changes.\n\n**2. Configure the `OAuth2AuthorizationServer` pattern:**\n\n1.  In NevisAdmin 4, locate or create the `OAuth2AuthorizationServer` pattern linked to your `Authentication Realm`.  This pattern configures the authorization server itself.\n2.  In the **Advanced Settings** section of the `OAuth2AuthorizationServer` pattern:\n    *   **`refreshTokenRotation`:** Set this to `enabled`. This ensures that a new refresh token is issued every time the access token is refreshed. If you disable this, the existing refresh token is reused (potentially leading to security issues if the refresh token is compromised).  This parameter is very important from a security point of view and should be activated, unless there is a very specific need to not activate this parameter.\n    *   **`absoluteRefreshTokenLifetime`:** (Optional) Set this to `true` to give the new refresh token issued by a refresh token operation the same expiration time as the old refresh token.  If `false` (default), the new token will expire `refreshTokenLifetime` seconds after it is issued. This is a more common setup where the refresh token lifetime is configured separately and independently of the access token lifetime.\n    *   **`refreshTokenLifetime`:** Set this property to define the lifetime of the refresh token in seconds.  Choose a value that meets your security needs and is in line with good security practices.\n    *   **`accessTokenLifetime`:** Configure how long the Access Token will be valid in seconds.\n\n3.  **`Save Changes`.**\n\n\n**3. Configure OAuth 2.0 Clients:**\n\n1.  In nevisMeta, locate or create the OAuth 2.0 client(s) that will be connecting to your authorization server.\n2.  Ensure the `offline_access` scope is included in the client's configured scopes.\n\n\n**4. Application-Side Changes:**\n\nYour application code will need to be updated to handle the refresh token appropriately.  After the initial authorization code exchange:\n\n1.  Your application will receive an `access_token` and a `refresh_token`.\n2.  When the `access_token` expires, use the `refresh_token` to request a new `access_token` (and potentially a new `refresh_token` depending on your `refreshTokenRotation` setting).   The token request should typically be made to the `/oauth/token` endpoint. This request often includes client credentials and the refresh token.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Security:**  Refresh tokens are powerful and should be handled with extreme care. Securely store these tokens and implement appropriate safeguards against unauthorized access. Consider using HTTPS for all communication with the authorization server.\n*   **Token Revocation:** Implement token revocation mechanisms in case of unauthorized access or suspected compromise.\n*   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test your integration of refresh tokens to ensure everything works as expected.  Use a tool like Postman to inspect the token responses.\n\n\nBy following these steps, you enable the issuance of refresh tokens in the authorization code flow, allowing for seamless and secure access token renewal.   Always refer to the detailed Nevis documentation for precise instructions and details specific to your version.\n\n",
